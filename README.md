### About Book Finder App ###

This project is based on based on a Harvard Library Lab project called the Awesome Box. Patrons could choose to put their library book in the 
"Awesome Box" and it would be scanned and the recommendation could be added as a recommendation for other patrons. 

This project will have a few phases:
1. Use Google Books API to look up the title from the ISBN.
2. Create a storage method for the recommended books.
3. Create an embeddable widget for libraries to use on their website.
4. Create a feed of titles for the libraries to stream on a monitor for patrons.
